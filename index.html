    <h2>Cities I have lived in</h2>
    <p> I was born on K.I. Sawyer Airforce Base in Marquette, Michigan. When I was three years old I moved to Colorado Springs to be close to my mom's familly while my dad was sent to Korea for a year. When my father returned from Okinawa my familly and I
        moved to Marietta, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta. After this we were stationed in Alamogordo, NM, followed by Hampton, VA. My father then retired from the Airforce and we moved back to Michigan. This time, we lived in New Baltimore.
